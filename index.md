# Céline Janssenswillen

## Personal note

Hello! I am Céline. I am a lawyer and student applied computer science. I am enthusiastic, eager to learn and a good planner. I feel comfortable with a good team around me, in which hard work is encouraged and appreciated. I like sports (especially swimming) and cooking for family and friends.

My long-term professional goal is to improve my technical skills, so that I can build a bridge between law/administration and technology. I want to gain experience in organizing digitization projects within government services, legal departments, law firms, etc. 

Personal favorite quote: _Do the best you can until you know better. Then when you know better, do better._ 

## Work experience 

### Legal Watch and Legal Tech Officer Belfius Bank
**September 2021-Present**

I am responsible for the follow-up of new regulations and the follow-up of legal tech projects. The "Legal Watch" - part implies a daily screening of a given source list. I have to inform all lawyers of all important changes and I have to make sure that those changes are implemented by the business. To avoid manual work, I wrote a python library to generate an Excel list of all articles published on a given source via web scraping. I made a webpage with a filter-function, to make sure that each lawyer can quickly consult the important changes for his/her specific domain on a daily basis.

### Internship notary
**September 2019 - September 2021**

I mainly focused on real estate topics: purchase and sale deeds.
