# Work experience 

### Legal Watch and Legal Tech Officer Belfius Bank
**September 2021-Present**

I am responsible for the follow-up of new regulations and the follow-up of legal tech projects. The "Legal Watch" - part implies a daily screening of a given source list. I have to inform all lawyers of all important changes and I have to make sure that those changes are implemented by the business. To avoid manual work, I wrote a python library to generate an Excel list of all articles published on a given source via web scraping. I made a webpage with a filter-function, to make sure that each lawyer can quickly consult the important changes for his/her specific domain on a daily basis.
